# Official-Reptron
Meet Reptron, a simple robotic creature that can glow in the dark. This species does not have any lore behind it, so feel free to do whatever you want with it.
The only thing I'll be asking is to credit me when you share the avatar, as I've put a lot of time and work on it and I'd prefer not having it stolen. The Reptron
is very basic in terms of design and doesn't feature any extra accessories, so it is pretty light on hardware.
I'll do my best to keep the avatar up to date, and if there is any issue with the unity package, feel free to inform me on GitHub or contact me on Discord.
My username is "blasterholobot".

I hope you'll enjoy this avatar base as much as I did making it. Have fun! :3
